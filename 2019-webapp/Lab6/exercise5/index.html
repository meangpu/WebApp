    <h1> In this exercise I modify it a little bit</h1>
    <h2>Things that I changed</h2>
    <p>

        <ul>
            <li>It won't allow user to click submit if user don't answer all the form</li>
            <li>It won't allow user to click submit if user put text in age form because I use type=number</li>
            <li>It won't allow user to click submit if email don't have xx@xx because I use type=email </li>
            <li>It will alert if name have more than 10 characters / if age is less than 1 or more than 100 </li>
            <li>It will alert if email don't have "."" behide "@"" , so the correct format will be "xxx@xx.xxx"</li>
            <li>*****The alert that say "Not a valid e-mail because it don't have @" can never be happened because if it don't have "@" user cannot click submit</li>
        </ul>
